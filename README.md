This rust binary is an implementation of the early 'chatbot' program **ELIZA**. The original program was developed from 1964 to 1966 at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum.

## Introduction

![convo](http://i.imgur.com/Z69mFI8.gif)

ELIZA simulates conversation by implementing _pattern matching_ and a _substitution methodology_ that gives users an illusion of understanding on the part of the program. Directives on how to process input are provided by 'scripts', (written originally in MAD-Slip, now in json) which allow ELIZA to engage in discourse by following script rules. Weizenbaumâ€™s intention was to demonstrate that the communication between man and machine is superficial. The most famous script, [DOCTOR](scripts/doctor.json), simulates a Rogerian psychotherapist.

## Installation

To install this rust binary, one can do so from source or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/eliza). In either case, you need to have the rust compiler and cargo [installed](https://rustup.rs/) on your system.

### From crates.io

Installing `eliza` from crates.io is quite simple with cargo:
```bash
user@foo(~) ~> cargo install eliza
```

### From source

After forking this project and cloning it to your local machine, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
user@foo(eliza-rs) ~> cargo build
```

You may also want to optionally run the unit tests to ensure ELIZA is behaving as expected:

```bash
user@foo(eliza-rs) ~> cargo test
```

## Usage

To start an ELIZA session, you must provide the binary with a path to an ELIZA script. This script takes the form of a `json` file. Assuming that you have installed from source and wanted to run the famous DOCTOR program, the command you would run from the project root would be similar to:

```bash
user@foo(eliza-rs) ~> cargo run scripts/doctor.json
...
```

If instead, you installed from crates.io, then the location of `doctor.json` will be different. Out of convenience I decided to bundle the `doctor.json` script with the eliza binary on crates.io. For each user, it's location will be slightly different within the crates registry, so I would suggest moving it to somewhere more memorable before running:

```bash
user@foo(~) ~> cp .cargo/registry/src/[some_hash]/eliza-[ver]/scripts/doctor.json .
user@foo(~) ~> eliza doctor.json
...
```

## Writing your own ELIZA script

The beauty of ELIZA's design methodology means that the role of the programmer and playwright are separated. An important property of ELIZA is that a script is data - it is not part of the program itself. Hence, ELIZA is not restricted to a particular set of recognition patterns or responses, indeed not even to any specific language.

As such, contributors may decide to improve the original `doctor.json` script or completely create their own from scratch. A simple example of a [pirate script](scripts/pirate.json) has been included to show how little is needed to start creating something neat.

More information on the structure of a script can be found in the documentation for the `script` module on [doc.rs](https://docs.rs/eliza).

### Testing

Due to the somewhat deterministic nature of ELIZA, you can write unit tests to evaluate script rules. For example, in `tests/conversation_test.rs`, you could add the following:

```rust
#[test]
fn your_test(){
    let mut e = Eliza::new("scripts/your_script.json").unwrap();
    assert_eq!("bar", e.respond("foo"));
}
```
> _Where 'foo' is the users input to ELIZA, and 'bar' is the response._

It is also important to note that ELIZA produces logging output. To observe these logs during program execution, start the binary with the environment variable `RUST_LOG=eliza`.
